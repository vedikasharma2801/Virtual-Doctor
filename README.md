The Virtual Doctor project leverages machine learning to provide preliminary medical diagnoses based on user-reported symptoms. 
This tool aims to offer quick, accessible health insights, potentially assisting users in identifying common diseases and understanding the necessary precautions and remedies.
By inputting symptoms, users receive a probable diagnosis, recommended precautions, and remedies, streamlining the initial steps in health care management.
